Furthermore, their quirky personalities are not\n","the strangest things about them: each inhabitant of the Maison de Ayakashi,\n","including Ririchiyo, is actually half-human, half-youkai.  But Ririchiyo's\n","troubles have only just begun. As a requirement of staying in her new home, she\n","must be accompanied by a Secret Service agent.

With Soushi, her new supernatural neighbors, and the beginning of\n","high school, Ririchiyo definitely seems to have a difficult path ahead of her.\n","[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","\u001b[1mRating:\u001b[0m PG-13 - Teens 13 or older\n","\u001b[1mYear:\u001b[0m 2012\n","\n"]}],"source":["# function to format text as paragraph in the style that I want\n","def format_text_as_paragraph(text, width=80):\n","    wrapped_text = textwrap.fill(text, width=width)\n","    return wrapped_text\n","\n","# function to format and generate anime card\n","def generate_anime_card(data):\n","    # displaying image using the URL\n","    image_url = data['images']['jpg']['large_image_url']\n","    display_image_from_url(image_url)\n","    formatted_synopsis = format_text_as_paragraph(data['synopsis'])\n","    card = (\n","        f\"\\033[1mAnime Title:\\033[0m {data['title']}\\n\"\n","        f\"\\033[1mType:\\033[0m {data['type']}\\n\"\n","        f\"\\033[1mSynopsis:\\033[0m {formatted_synopsis}\\n\"\n","        f\"\\033[1mRating:\\033[0m {data['rating']}\\n\"\n","        f\"\\033[1mYear:\\033[0m {data.get('year', 'N/A')}\\n\"\n","    )\n","    return card\n","\n","# function to display image from URL\n","def display_image_from_url(url):\n","    display(Image(url=url))\n","\n","# this is the Jikan API â€”Â unofficial MyAnimeList API\n","    \"\"\"\n","    You can use this API to fetch anime data.
